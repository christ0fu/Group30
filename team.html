Engineer roles where chosen by 2 members and are similar in that they are a creative position, but apply different principles to their work.

An architect, chosen by Edwin, Is another similar role as is also a very creative heavy role. An architect may not be responsible for the labour of coding specific applications or features like a developer may be, but will have included them on the design for a project.
